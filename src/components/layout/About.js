        Greetings! I am Pedro, from Brazil, 22, computering Engineering student
        (UFSC). I spent a year in Czech Republic for exchange so I improved my
        english and spanish language skills and learned czech quite well. I have
        barely completed half of my degree, however, I am focused on the MERN
        (Mongo, Express, React and Node) stack a lot lately as well as and web
        development in general. I saw this opportunity on a great location. I
        love the culture there and the life quality expressed by the respect and
        equality-efforts. If you like what I've coded so far or would give me a
        shot by testing me, let's get in touch. Thanks!.
